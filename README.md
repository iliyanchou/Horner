A simple program, that takes the degree of an a polynomial and the coefficients of it and uses horner's method to tell you the remainder of a specific value or is it a root. For example if you have P(x) = x^2-x-6 , the coefficients are 1,-1 and -6 the degree is 2 if you put these values in the program and tell it a value like -2 it will tell you that is a root and it will give you the quotient x-3.
